Demo prerendering feature via `game`` and cl_renderdemo_fps. Playing a demo with cl_renderdemo 1 will essentially "render" a sequence of accumulated frames (according to pt_accumulation_rendering_framenum cvar) at the framerate of cl_renderdemo_fps to your game/screenshots folder (eg basenac/screenshots) with demoname_framenumber syntax. This sequence of images can then be imported to video editor of your choice to be compiled to a movie. To capture sound you need to do a separate run without demo rendering enabled whilst maintaining same target framerate (so RTX off is recommended and framerate lock via r_maxfps should be used) and record the audio with external software of your choice.

Mode0 Exp based fog t = T * T * T
Mode1 Exp2 based fog t = T * T
Mode2 Exp2 based fog t = T * T * T * RNG
Mode3 Exp2 Mode2 + no sun phase cherry

Mode 0 & 1 have no godrays and have been coded to use Spherical Fibonacci Blue Noise
Mode 2 & 3 use the inscatter as outscatter input

pt_focus 1
Sets the distance to the focal plane for the Depth of Field effect.

pt_aperture 0.01
Controls the size of the camera aperture for the Depth of Field effect, in world units.

pt_freecam 0
Enables free floating camera when the game is paused. Default value is 1.

pt_dof

0 — always disabled
1 — enabled only in the photo mode (default)
2 — enabled in the photo mode and when the denoiser is disabled
3 — always enabled (NOTE: do not expect good image quality with the denoiser)
pt_aperture_angle
Sets the rotation angle of the camera aperture.

pt_aperture_type
Sets the type of the camera aperture. 0-2 means circular aperture, 3 or more specifies
the number of edges for a polygonal aperture.

skyplanet - removes planet rendering

target_change
This allows setting a zero value for skinnum, effects, renderfx, startframe, and framenumbers.  So you MUST include those values for the target_change, as it will zero them out if they are not set, as all fields default to 0

New Lights
Light style presets 0 - 11 still exists, Presets for each Light Animation can now:
Play once and hold
Loop
Ping Pong
(trigger can be used to reverse a Play once and hold)

Each Light Can be assigned a custom Light Style in TB(200 max length of animation)
Custom Light Styles for each Light Animation can:
Play once and hold
Loop
Ping Pong
(trigger can be used to reverse a Play once and hold)

All lights styles are full 26 Phase a-z

target_light
trigger_light
Both can be used to control light properties

target_lightLS
trigger_lightLS
Both can be used to control light style properties

Spot and Directional lights can be assigned a target to look at, if target moves it updates to look at the new position, I recommend using a target for all directional or spots that are not easy front back up down type of orientations because it gives you the nice arrow between your light and target.

Per each light, the style animation can be run at any hz set in TB you could run animation at 10hz or 60hz even 120hz or anywhere in between so if you do not like 30hz the default just change each light to your likening

target_lighttracker 
is used to set a light to a control entity to look at target. this target can be attached to any entity with a targetname for movewith, I have added attach offset so you can control the tracker position say above player if you don't want it inside the set entity.

All the original fgd lights properties still exists but none are used but the following.
_color
